            There is no way we will discussion about dishes without mentioning
            about our local foods, which was discovered even before procces foods
            were discovered.The idea about different kind of dishes is not to
            neglect one and pick the other but to bring back the value of our
            local foods which have been in existence for decades of years.
            <br> Before our environment got polluted by those companies who
            don't care about our natural environment but thier self interest.

           and well prepared like the one above and below, we won't be able to

          Foods have been a source of means how we humans survive over the years no
          Doubt that, for humans, food means a lot. over the years we have
          involved in different means of food production thanks to revolution
          and we humans have moved so fast in discovering and inventing all
          Kinds of foods. Even has we have expanded our food production and
          Invention some of these inventions have been harmful to our health
          That these foods pose a threat to our health, thanks to health care
          Who also stands in the cap of producing several means to make sure we
          Don't have food poisoning. <br /> As we all know junks food and fast
          Food is not the kinds only kind of food we have, over the years we have also
          came up with different recipes and patterns of all kind of foods. i
          think it's time we also talk about natural foods which are local foods
          invented by our accessenstors which are know to be natural and well
          prepared.
